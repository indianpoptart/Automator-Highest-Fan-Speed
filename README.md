Automator-Highest-Fan-Speed
===========================

ONLY FOR MAC laptops, this workflow turns on your fan to the highest it can go, while looping it for however long you want it to go.

This workflow will require [SMCFanControl](http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/23049/smcfancontrol)

I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES DONE TO YOUR COMPUTER, OR THE INABILITY TO STOP YOUR FANS. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR FAN BREAKING OR DYING. USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK.
